# Portfolio for Harris Rose

Two projects are included her for review.  

1. [Blackjack Reinforcement Learning Project](/Blackjack_Project/System_Project_Blackjack_Learning_HarrisRose.ipynb)

This project was created to test the ability of RL and DQN's to learn an optimal strategy as compared to a Medium article we were provided which had some issues.

This [notebook](/Blackjack_Project/System_Project_Blackjack_Learning_HarrisRose.ipynb) summarizes the results and all code files can found in this [folder](/Blackjack_Project).

2. [Development of Strategies for Use of Reinforcement Learning in Financial Trading](https://github.com/harrisrose/Portfolio/blob/main/Reinforcement_Learning_for%20Trading_HarrisRose.pdf)

This paper describes some early strategic considerations for deplotment of RL in trading applications.
